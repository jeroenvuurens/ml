    "So now we've seen how linear regression works analytically. Although it does not seem to be too hard to program a regression algorithm, there can be a lot of complications. Things work differently when for instance the data set is \\*big\\* and when there are many features. This means that if we code everything from scratch, we have to be very careful not to make mistakes. Another issue is that Gradient Descent sometimes converges very slowly and although speeding up learning is possible, it also makes the program quite a bit more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we can use an existing implementation. For Python, may popular algorithms have already been written an added to an open source library. These algorithms are often rigorously  tested, well documented and very efficient (in fact, most algorithms were implemented in a fast language like Fortran or C++ and made accessible from Python). Choosing an existing implementation makes coding \\*a lot\\* easier and you are far less likely to make mistakes. So why is Python most popular for scripting Data Science experiments and not one of these fast languages? This is probably partly because Python is comprehensive, compact, highly readable, interactive and very easy to learn and use. We have seen that a less efficient language does have its disadvantages for processing large-data volumes, but if the libraries we use do the heavy lifting we will not notice much drop in performance."
